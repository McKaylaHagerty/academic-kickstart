I am a highly motivated, detail-oriented, self-starter constantly seeking ways to apply and expand my education and growing knowledge of mathematics and data science. I recently earned my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics with a marketing minor. Throughout my undergraduate career, I developed advanced logic and problem-solving skills to tackle a wide variety of challenges and discovered a fascination for big data analytics and technology-enhanced learning. This lead me to continue my education at Old Dominion University by pursuing my master's degree in Data Science and Analytics. 

I have worked in a variety of individual and group-oriented positions within various industries including youth sports, marketing, nonprofits, and education. This diverse background has allowed me to prove my dedication and go-getter nature while preparing me to be an effective leader and problem solver in all real-world situations.
